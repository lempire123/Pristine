# Pristine - *CDP for bitcoin*

The following is protocol similar to https://docs.liquity.org. So read those docs for more detail on how CDPs work.

No code was copied from liquity - hence it's very likely there's bugs in the code.

# Technical details: 

- Collat token is wBTC
- Collateral ratio is 110%
- No interest on loans
- Liquidations can happen when collat ratio is < 110%
- Full amount of collat is lost during liquidation
